                        <p>The Access and Benefit-sharing Clearing-House (ABS Clearing-House, ABSCH) is a platform for
                            exchanging information on access and benefit-sharing established by <a
                                href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-14">Article 14</a> of
                            the Nagoya Protocol, as part of clearing-house mechanism under <a

                                paragraph 3</a> of the Convention. The ABS Clearing-House is a key tool for facilitating
                            the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol by enhancing legal certainty, clarity and
                            transparency on procedures for access and for monitoring the utilization of genetic
                            resources along the value chain. By making relevant information regarding ABS available, the
                            ABS Clearing-House helps users access genetic resources and associated traditional
                            knowledge, and providers fairly and equitably share in the benefits arising from their
                            utilization.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/">The Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing
                                (ABS)</a> was negotiated in order to provide greater legal certainty and transparency
                            for both providers and users of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge by:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Establishing more predictable conditions for access to those resources; and</li>
                            <li>Helping to ensure benefit-sharing when genetic resources leave the contracting Party
                                providing the genetic resources.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Researchers and businesses need legal clarity, certainty and transparency when accessing
                            genetic resources and/or associated traditional knowledge. Without such legal certainty,
                            potential users of genetic resources and/or associate traditional knowledge could be less
                            eager to invest in bioprospecting and researching activities, as their activities may lead
                            to controversy and allegations of misappropriation or misuse of these resources or
                            knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Providers of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, on the other hand, want
                            to ensure that benefits arising from the utilization of their resources are shared in a fair
                            and equitable manner once the resource or knowledge leaves the country.</p>

                        <p>The Nagoya Protocol's provisions on access, benefit-sharing and compliance provide a
                            framework that aims to address the concerns of both users and providers. However, in order
                            to translate the Nagoya Protocol into practice, Parties need to create the necessary
                            conditions and take the measures required by the Protocol to ensure that a national
                            framework is in place to implement ABS at the national level and enable the development of
                            ABS agreements for the benefit of all involved in the process. It is in this context and
                            with this aim that Parties to the CBD included <a
                                href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-14">Article 14 </a>in
                            the Nagoya Protocol, which establishes the ABS Clearing-House.</p>
                        <p>The Nagoya Protocol establishes the ABS Clearing-House, as part of the clearing-house
                            mechanism of the Convention, as a means for sharing information related to access and
                            benefit-sharing, and in particular its goal is to provide access to information made
                            available by each Party relevant to the implementation of the Protocol.</p>
                        <p>The ABS Clearing-House allows countries to share information on procedures for accessing
                            genetic resources and monitor the utilization of the resources along the value chain. The
                            ABS Clearing-House plays a key role in enhancing the legal certainty and transparency that
                            both providers and users of genetic resources, as well as associated traditional knowledge,
                            are looking for.</p>
